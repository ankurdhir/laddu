# Cursor Master Prompt

## Protein & Fitness Laddoo – Static Animated Website

> **Purpose of this document**
> This is the **single source of truth** prompt to be pasted into **Cursor**.
> It is intentionally explicit to prevent over-engineering, wrong frameworks, backend hallucinations, or animation abuse.
> This document will be refined iteratively as the build progresses.

## 1. Role & Objective

You are an **expert frontend engineer and UI developer**.

Your task is to **build a fully static, highly visual, animated website** for a brand called **“Protein & Fitness Laddoo”**, strictly following the requirements and constraints below.

The final site must feel:

* Premium
* Warm & appetizing
* Modern fitness-focused (not clinical)
* Fast, smooth, and conversion-oriented

---

## 2. Core Constraints (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Deployment

* Must be deployable on **GitHub Pages**
* Must be a **fully static website**
* Use **only**:

  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript (ES6 modules)

🚫 **Do NOT use**:

* React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js
* Node.js servers
* Firebase / Supabase / backend APIs
* Build steps, bundlers, or CLIs
* Databases or authentication systems

---

## 3. Mandatory Tech Stack

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN or compiled static CSS)
* **Animations:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

  * Use GSAP **only** for:

    * Hero section animations
    * “Build Your Laddoo” configurator feedback
    * Scroll-based section reveals
  * Avoid animating every UI element
* **Icons:** Lucide Icons or Phosphor Icons (SVG-based)
* **State Management:** Client-side JavaScript only

---

## 3.1 Image Sourcing & Usage (IMPORTANT)

**Image Source Rules**

* Use **free, online-available images only** with permissive licenses
* Preferred sources:

  * Unsplash
  * Pexels
  * Pixabay
* Do NOT hotlink images; download and store them locally in the repo
* Always choose images that match the brand style (warm, food-focused, premium)

**Image Style Reference**

* Follow the visual direction shown in the **sample website mockup image** previously shared:

  * Large hero laddoo close-ups
  * Floating ingredient elements around the product
  * Clean, modern layout with strong imagery
  * Soft shadows and warm lighting

**Placeholders**

* If exact images are not available, use high-quality placeholders from the sources above
* Image filenames should clearly indicate intent (e.g., hero-laddoo.jpg, badam-laddoo.jpg)

---

* **Styling:** Tailwind CSS (via CDN or compiled static CSS)
* **Animations:** GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform)

  * Use GSAP **only** for:

    * Hero section animations
    * “Build Your Laddoo” configurator feedback
    * Scroll-based section reveals
  * Avoid animating every UI element
* **Icons:** Lucide Icons or Phosphor Icons (SVG-based)
* **State Management:** Client-side JavaScript only

---

## 4. Design Philosophy – “Modern Heritage”

### Visual Direction

* Traditional Indian warmth + modern fitness clarity
* Cream / off-white backgrounds (❌ avoid pure white)
* Saffron gold, nut browns, pistachio greens
* Premium food photography (warm light, shallow depth)
* No gym clichés, no medical/pharma aesthetics

### UX Rules

* Mobile-first
* Large touch targets
* Hover effects must degrade gracefully on mobile
* Animations must enhance clarity, not distract from ordering
* Site must remain usable with reduced motion enabled

---

## 5. Pages & Sections

### 5.1 Homepage

**Hero Section**

* Large laddoo visual
* Floating ingredient elements (subtle GSAP animation)
* Headline:

  > “Protein-packed laddoos. Built for your goals.”

**Primary CTAs**

* Build Your Laddoo
* Explore Fitness Laddoos

**Goal Entry Cards**

* Muscle
* Recovery
* Endurance
* Low Sugar

---

### 5.2 Fitness Laddoos (Presets)

Create product cards for:

1. Mix Dry Fruit Laddoo – Everyday Strength
2. Badam-Dominant Laddoo – Mind & Energy
3. Kaju-Dominant Laddoo – Muscle & Recovery
4. Gond Laddoo – Joint & Warmth
5. Protein-Packed Laddoo – Gym Fuel (with Whey)
6. Omega Recovery Laddoo
7. Endurance Seed Laddoo
8. Light Energy Makhana Laddoo

Each card must display:

* Image placeholder
* Dominant ingredient badge
* 2–3 fitness tags (Protein / Omega / Energy)
* “View Details” CTA

---

### 5.3 Ingredient Transparency Section

Ingredient cards must show:

* Ingredient name
* One-line positive benefit
* Icons for muscle / energy / recovery

Rules:

* No medical or disease claims
* Simple, friendly language only

---

### 5.4 Build Your Own Laddoo (Configurator) – CRITICAL FEATURE

#### Layout

* Desktop: Split screen
* Mobile: Stacked

#### Visual Area

* Central laddoo image
* Ingredients visually add to the laddoo (GSAP-driven, subtle)

#### Controls

* Custom sliders (not browser defaults) for:

  * Badam
  * Kaju
  * Akhrot
  * Seeds
  * Whey Protein (optional)
* Selectors for:

  * Base (Besan / Aata / Goond)
  * Fat (Ghee / Oil)
  * Sweetener (Honey / Jaggery / Sugar / Sugar-Free)
* Quantity selector (kg)

#### Real-time Feedback

* Nutrition panel:

  * Calories
  * Protein
  * Carbs
  * Fats
* Live price calculation
* Smooth number transitions using GSAP

#### Logic Rules

* Enforce ingredient min/max limits
* Ensure laddoo is physically feasible (binding rules)
* Show friendly UI feedback when constraints break

---

## 6. Ordering System (NO BACKEND)

### Order Flow

1. User fills form:

   * Name
   * Phone
   * Address
   * Selected laddoo (preset or custom)
2. On “Place Order”:

   * Generate client-side Order ID (timestamp + random suffix)
   * POST order data to **Google Apps Script Webhook**
   * Open **WhatsApp** with a pre-filled message containing order details

### Rules

* No payments
* No sensitive data storage
* Basic client-side validation required

---

## 7. Performance & Quality Bar

* Page load < 3s on mobile
* Lazy-load images below the fold
* Keep JavaScript lightweight
* Animations must be non-blocking
* Core functionality must work without animations

---

## 8. Deliverables

Produce:

* Clean, well-structured HTML files
* Modular, readable JavaScript
* Tailwind-based styling
* Placeholder images where required
* Clear inline comments for key logic

Also include:

* A short README explaining:

  * GitHub Pages deployment steps
  * Google Apps Script webhook configuration

---

## 9. Absolute DO NOTs

🚫 Do NOT introduce:

* Backend servers
* Frontend frameworks
* Authentication
* Payment gateways
* Overly complex or excessive animations
* Medical or disease-related claims

---

## 10. Success Criteria

The final site should:

* Feel premium and appetizing within 5 seconds
* Make customization fun and intuitive
* Clearly communicate nutrition and benefits
* Be fast, stable, and GitHub Pages–ready
